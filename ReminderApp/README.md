# üìù ReminderApp

#### ReminderApp is a project that I have developed for learning purposes quite a long time ago. This is the refreshed version that converted an app from a simple reminder scheduler to a to-do list app. I've built it using UIKit and MVVM pattern for it's business logic. This project is a complete app with a responsive UI and complete business logic.
